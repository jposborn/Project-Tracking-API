# Project Tracker

A portfolio project I am developing as part of my Django REST Framework study. The Project Tracker provides an API that allows users to create projects and then assign other users and tasks to each one with progress of each task automatically contributing to the overall project progress. The project includes user registration, login and logout along with token authentication. Access to create, retrieve, update and delete tasks, projects and user assignments is controlled through custom permissions.
